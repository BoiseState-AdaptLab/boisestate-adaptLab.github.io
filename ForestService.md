# Digitizing Historical Forest Service Data

**_Problem Statement:_** Forest service data has been recorded on datasheets by hands for decates. Handwritten data is often lost or not utilized for research because of its unpractical format. 

**_Proposed Solution:_** Create a program able to scan the datasheets, extract the handwritten data and map it to machine encoded text in order to make it available for scientific studies.
